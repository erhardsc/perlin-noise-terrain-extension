Perlin Noise Start Page
===============

Custom start page and new tab page for Google Chrome.

How to add to Chrome:
* Go to `chrome://extensions/` and check "Load unpacked extension". Now navigate to this folder.

* In addition, drag the `newtab.html` file into Chrome. Then go to `chrome://settings/` and click "Open a specific
page or set of pages" under "On startup". Now click "Use current pages" to set the homepage.

* Uninstallation is the reverse of installation; change your home page back and uninstall the extension.


How to add to Firefox (doesn't require extension):
* Drag `newtab.html` into Firefox. Then go to Options and under Home Page, click "Use Current Page".
* NOTE: Firefox doesn't like gradients so the background is slightly modified from the Chrome version.

* Open a new tab and type `about:config` in the address bar. Search for `browser.newtab.url`.

* Double click on it and copy the home page url from Options into the field.

* Uninstallation is the reverse of installation; change your home page back and fix `about:config`.
